# Loan-Status-Prediction-Model
Our goal is to build a Machine Learning Model to predict the loan to be approved or to be rejected for an applicant.
In this Loan Status Prediction dataset, we have the data of applicants who previously applied for the loan based on the property which is a Property Loan.
The bank will decide whether to give a loan to the applicant based on some factors such as Applicant Income, Loan Amount, previous Credit History, Co-applicant Income, etcâ€¦
